I want to change the plan for the docking project. Instead of the multi-layered approach with custom algorithms, I want to implement YOLOv8 for the entire image analysis process.

Provide a detailed plan for how we would use YOLOv8 to detect and analyze the target pattern for the docking application. This plan should include:

Data Preparation: How would we create a dataset for training YOLOv8 to recognize the specific components of our target pattern? What steps would be involved in data collection, annotation, and augmentation?

Model Selection and Training: Which YOLOv8 model variant would be most suitable for this high-precision task? What would the training process look like? What specific metrics would we use to evaluate the model's performance, given the no-room-for-error requirement of the application?

Inference and Post-Processing: Once the model is trained, how would we use it to get real-time position data (coordinates, vectors, etc.) from a live video feed? What post-processing steps would be necessary to ensure the detected objects are correctly interpreted and the required data is extracted for the docking procedure?

Risk Assessment: Discuss the potential challenges and limitations of using a pre-trained model like YOLOv8 for such a high-stakes, safety-critical application. What are the risks, and how would we mitigate them to ensure absolute reliability?
